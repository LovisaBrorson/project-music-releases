# Music Releases
We use React for the firts time and created new a page which shows new album and single releases from 2019 by used a data fetch.

## The problem

We have a ready design to follow and it went quite good without problems. We had a problem to import the icons into the right component.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
